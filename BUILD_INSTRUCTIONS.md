## How to Build Your Reel Classifier APK

### Method 1: Fix EAS Build (Recommended)

The build failures are happening due to a Gradle configuration issue. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Update your app.json to fix package configuration:**
   - The build system is detecting conflicting package information
   - We need to ensure consistency between app.json and Android manifest

2. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Projects Files\app\reel-classifier"
   npx expo prebuild --clean --platform android
   npx eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache
   ```

### Method 2: Use Expo Go (Quick Testing)

For immediate testing on your device:

1. Install Expo Go from Google Play Store
2. Run: `npx expo start`
3. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app

### Method 3: Manual EAS Build with Fixed Configuration

I'll update your configuration to fix the build issues:

1. Updated eas.json with better build configuration
2. The build should work now with the corrected settings

### Method 4: Online Alternative

If the above methods still fail, you can:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Use Expo's online build service at https://expo.dev
3. Connect your GitHub repo and build online

### Getting the APK

Once the build succeeds, you'll get:
- A download link for the APK file
- You can install it directly on your Android device
- The APK will be signed and ready for installation

### Troubleshooting

The main issue was:
- Gradle build failures due to Android SDK configuration
- Package name conflicts between app.json and Android manifest
- Missing Java environment for local builds

The updated configuration should resolve these issues.
