🎯 CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY - STEP BY STEP

========================================
  GITHUB REPOSITORY CREATION GUIDE
========================================

📋 STEP 1: Create Repository on GitHub
-----------------------------------------
The browser should have opened https://github.com/new

On that page:
1. Repository name: reel-classifier
2. Description: Instagram Reel Classifier App with Gemini AI
3. ✅ Keep it PUBLIC (for free GitHub Actions)
4. ❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
5. ❌ DO NOT check "Add .gitignore" 
6. ❌ DO NOT check "Choose a license"
7. Click "Create repository"

📋 STEP 2: After Creating Repository
-----------------------------------------
After clicking "Create repository", GitHub will show you setup instructions.
IGNORE those instructions and come back here.

📋 STEP 3: Push Your Code
-----------------------------------------
Run this command in the terminal:

    git push -u origin main

📋 STEP 4: Watch the Magic Happen! 🎉
-----------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/SaurabMishra12/reel-classifier
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. You'll see "Build Android APK" workflow running
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for it to complete
5. Download your APK from "Releases" section!

========================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

❓ If repository creation fails:
   - Make sure you're logged into GitHub
   - Try using a different repository name
   - Check if you have permission to create repositories

❓ If push fails:
   - Make sure the repository was created successfully
   - Check your GitHub username is correct: SaurabMishra12
   - Try: git remote -v (should show the correct URL)

❓ If GitHub Actions doesn't start:
   - The workflow should start automatically
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Make sure the repository is public (private repos have limited free Actions)

========================================
  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
========================================

✅ Automatic APK builds on every code push
✅ No local Android SDK needed
✅ Professional CI/CD pipeline
✅ Free with GitHub Actions
✅ APK download from releases

Your APK will be available at:
https://github.com/SaurabMishra12/reel-classifier/releases
